Lern2ern Web3 Design Challenge Submission

Overview
This is our submission for the Lern2ern Web3 Design Challenge. We coded the following key components:
Onboarding Screen: A beginner-friendly interface to guide first-time users.
Token Dashboard: A simple, easy-to-understand token tracker.
Digital Wallet Interface: A beginner-friendly wallet for tracking Lerntokens.

Code Explanation
We’ve built these components with a focus on simplicity and usability, ensuring that new users can navigate the platform with ease. The UI is clean, and we’ve implemented the core Web3 features to ensure smooth user interaction without requiring prior crypto knowledge.

 Why This Design?
Beginner-Friendly: The user interface (UI) is clean, with minimal jargon and clear instructions, aimed at making it accessible to all users.
LERN2ERN Concepts: The code integrates key elements of the Lern2ern ecosystem and Web3 principles, making it easy for users to interact with tokens and rewards.
